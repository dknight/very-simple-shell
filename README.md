This is my primitive shell. It has a lot limitations like:
- Support only 2 pipes.
- Stream redirection to append file isn't suppoerted (>>)- This is very very basic version with bugs.

NB! USE IT AT OWN RISK!

Here are some special functions:
help - prints this message
hello - prints welcome message.
bye - same as exit, exis from program.
history - prints commands history

```
